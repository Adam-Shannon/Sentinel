# Sentinel
DSL to build fixed format schema and check validity of files against that schema (eventually help with reading).

The goal of Sentinel is to make scientific / engineering programming easier by allowing users to define with a rich DSL how their data should look and
subsequently enforce that format, this will allow for massive time saving and wasted programming effort validating inputs within scientific code 
and may eventually provide functionality for efficient reading in of data in popular languages.
